Pylocker
===
Cryptolocker implemented in python. When pointed at a directory, it will recursively encrypt all files in that directory with AES128.

### To-Do:
* Randomly generate key and place it in a file (Just kept it static for testing and ease of use).
* Haven't decided if I then want to encrypt the symmetric key with an asymmteric key. 
* While binaries still work, seems to make them smaller. Rather concerning but in a competition scenerio seems less concerning.
